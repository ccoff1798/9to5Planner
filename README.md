# 9to5Planner

## Description

This web application is designed to keep track of a typical 9 to 5 work schedule using your local system time, along with saving tasks for the day that are persistant in local storage

## User information
Click on any box to enter in a task for that time, make sure to hit the save icon to make sure it stays there on refresh. The boxes will be gray if the hour has passed, red if it is in current hour, and green if it is an hour in the future!
